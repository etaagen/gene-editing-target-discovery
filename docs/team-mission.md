## Team mission

The Gene Editing Target Discovery team identifies, prioritizes, and de-risks editing targets that can translate into pipeline programs.

## What we own
- Target nomination and rationale
- Cross-functional alignment with Regulatory and IP
- Decision documentation for target scope and constraints

## Who we partner with
- Regulatory: guidance and constraints that impact filing and study design
- IP: patentability, prior art review, and scope implications
- Program leadership: portfolio tradeoffs and capital allocation

## What "durable" means here
Decisions remain traceable, attributable, and visible over time - not just stored, but preserved with context.
