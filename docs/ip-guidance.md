### Summary
This page captures the current guidance that constrains target selection and influences IP strategy. The published page reflects the latest approved view.

### Current guidance (today)
- Target Category A is eligible for the current filing pathway with standard documentation.
- Target Category B requires additional evidence before filing decisions.
- Target Category C should be treated as exploratory until updated guidance is confirmed.

### Implications for target selection and IP scope
- Targets in Category B require earlier regulatory consultation and tighter documentation.
- Category C targets should not be included in near-term IP scope assumptions.
- Prioritization rubric must explicitly capture category-based constraints.

### Open questions
- Confirm whether Category B requirements apply uniformly across indications.
- Validate Category C guidance with updated external guidance.
