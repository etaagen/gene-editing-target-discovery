### Summary
This page captures the current guidance that constrains target selection and influences IP strategy. The published page reflects the latest approved view.

### Current guidance (today)

- Target Category A is eligible for the current filing pathway with standard documentation.
- Target Category B requires additional evidence before filing decisions.
- Target Category C should be treated as exploratory until updated guidance is confirmed.

#### Competitor Patent Filing - Regulatory Element
- Competitor X filed on a synthetic liver-tropic enhancer improving transgene expression 3-fold in murine models
- Potential overlap with our vector optimization program
- Action: initiate FTO review and assess design-around options

#### Patent Expiration - Transformation Method
- Core claims on high-efficiency plant transformation expiring (Q4 2026)
- Opens opportunity for in-house use without licensing fees
- Recommendation: evaluate pipeline acceleration post-expiry

#### Synthetic Promoter Platform - Competitive Threat
- Broad claims on machine-designed minimal promoters
- Risk of blocking claims in hematopoietic applications
- Identified potential whitespace in inducible promoter variants


### Implications for target selection and IP scope
- Targets in Category B require earlier regulatory consultation and tighter documentation.
- Category C targets should not be included in near-term IP scope assumptions.
- Prioritization rubric must explicitly capture category-based constraints.

### Open questions
- Confirm whether Category B requirements apply uniformly across indications.
- Validate Category C guidance with updated external guidance.
